/**
 * 1381: Design a Stack With Increment Operation
 * Medium
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-stack-with-increment-operation/
 *
 * You are to design a stack which supports the following operations:
 * * CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
 * * void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack hasnâ€™t reached the maxSize.
 * * int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.
 * * void increment(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are fewer than k elements, increment all of them.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * ["CustomStack","push","push","pop","push","push","push","increment","increment","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
 * [[3],[1],[2],[],[2],[3],[4],[5,100],[2,100],[],[],[],[]]
 * Output:
 * [null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,103,202,201,-1]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= maxSize, x, k <= 1000
 * - 0 <= val <= 100
 * - At most 1000 calls will be made to push, pop, and increment respectively
 *
 * @param maxSize maximum capacity of the custom stack
